## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this project I was able to use the basic flexbox properties to produce the expected layout:

```css
.container {
      ...
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: column;
      align-items: center;
      justify-content: center;
}
```

### Continued development

It was the first time I used flexbox and therefore I only learned the basics of how to do the project. Now I need to delve deeper and explore this technique to the fullest.
